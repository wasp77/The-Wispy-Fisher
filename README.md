The web has become a place where we share some of our most inti- mate information. Furthermore, it has become a platform for business and politics. Because of this, we need to make sure web security stays up to date with the latest threats as this is critical to keeping data safe from malicious persons.
To raise peoplesâ€™ awareness of the most common and severe web application vulnerabilities I have developed an interactive site that allows individuals to experience some of these vulnerabilities first- hand. This site is further linked with an educational manual describing the vulnerabilities, and giving hints and tips on how to test for and protect against them.

## User Manual
